Mailing a document can be cumbersome for anyone who doesn’t have easy access to a post office or a printer. You’ll need an envelope and stamps, or you’ll need to stand in line at the post office to pay even if you’re trying to get an ultimately electronic document from point A to B.

Mail a PDF Online lets you do exactly what it says with a simple one-page interface, leveraging the [Lob](https://lob.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) APIs for shipment and payment. Upload a PDF – we resize it to letter dimensions if necessary – and enter your "from" and "to" addresses – we validate them in case you make a mistake. Choose shipping options and pay, all under 60 seconds. Take a look at the accompanying video.

The interface is designed to be fast, self explanatory, and error tolerant. It provides concise information, instant feedback when appropriate, and upfront pricing.
