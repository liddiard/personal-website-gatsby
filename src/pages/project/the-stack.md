In Spring 2015, the Daily Bruin launched The Stack, a data journalism and newsroom tech blog intended to give developers in Daily Bruin's Online department a space to create and showcase their own work, experiment with data visualizations, and build newsroom tools.

I became the editor of The Stack in the summer of 2015. I planned and executed a full branding and website redesign in which I migrated the site to a Jekyll-based platform hosted on GitHub Pages and established brand and style guidelines for blog. Subsequently, I covered funding for USAC (UCLA's student government) on the blog, among other news events.

As editor, I assigned stories, worked with journalists and developers to establish strategies for tackling the technical challenges of posts, and guided them in the writing process. In addition, I reviewed code and edited writing to realize clear, significant stories with a data analysis/visualization angle of relevance to the UCLA community.
