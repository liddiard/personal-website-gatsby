I recorded a friendâ€™s wedding photo shoot and reception, and I created graphics and photo montages that were shown on monitors at the reception.

For the wedding photo shoot video, I tried to supplement the photography by capturing the subtle, intimate moments between posed shots when I felt the couple was their most genuine and expressive.

I shot on a Canon T2i with an 18-135mm zoom lens using manual focus, exposure, and shutter speed. I used a wide aperture for narrow depth of field. This made pulling focus more challenging but resulted in clean shots focused on the couple. I used [Magic Lantern](http://www.magiclantern.fm) to enable camera features like focus dots and zebra stripes.

I did color grading and video editing in [Blender](https://www.blender.org). I aimed for a bright, golden color palette with light vignetting. I cut on action between similar clips and used cutaways to closeups to create natural transitions.
